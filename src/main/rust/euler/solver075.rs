/// It turns out that `12cm` is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.
/// ```
/// 12cm: (3,4,5)
/// 24cm: (6,8,10)
/// 30cm: (5,12,13)
/// 36cm: (9,12,15)
/// 40cm: (8,15,17)
/// 48cm: (12,16,20)
/// ```
/// In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using `120cm` it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.
/// ```
/// 120cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

/// Given that `L` is the length of the wire, for how many values of `L â‰¤ 1,500,000` can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?
