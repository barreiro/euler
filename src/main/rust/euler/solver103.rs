/// Let `S(A)` represent the sum of elements in set `A` of size `n`. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, `B` and `C`, the following properties are true:
///
/// `S(B) â‰  S(C)`; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
/// If `B` contains more elements than `C` then `S(B) > S(C)`.
///
/// If `S(A)` is minimised for a given `n`, we shall call it an optimum special sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.
/// ```
/// n = 1: {1}
/// n = 2: {1, 2}
/// n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
/// n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
/// n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}
/// ```
/// It seems that for a given optimum set, `A = {a1, a2, ... , an}`, the next optimum set is of the form `B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}`, where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.
/// By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for `n = 6` to be `A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}`, with `S(A) = 117`.
/// However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set.
/// The optimum set for `n = 6` is `A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}`, with `S(A) = 115` and corresponding set string: `111819202225`.
///
/// Given that `A` is an optimum special sum set for `n = 7`, find its set string.
