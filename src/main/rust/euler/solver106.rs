/// Let `S(A)` represent the sum of elements in set `A` of size `n`. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, `B` and `C`, the following properties are true:
///
/// `S(B) â‰  S(C)`; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
/// If `B` contains more elements than `C` then `S(B) > S(C)`.
/// For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains `n` strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
///
/// Surprisingly, out of the `25` possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which `n = 4`, only `1` of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule).
/// Similarly, when `n = 7`, only `70` out of the `966` subset pairs need to be tested.
///
/// For `n = 12`, how many of the `261625` subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?
///
/// NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.
