/**
 * Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
 * 192 × 1 = 192
 * 192 × 2 = 384
 * 192 × 3 = 576
 * By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
 * <p>
 * The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
 * <p>
 * What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?
